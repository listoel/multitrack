Introduction
============

``multitrack`` is a code for simplified particle tracking in storage
rings, assuming the presence of at least one sextupole. Its intended
use is simple studies of the effects of additional higher order
multipoles and/or massless septa. It was written with some studies for
the CERN SPS in mind.

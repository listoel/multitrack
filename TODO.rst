Funcionality still to be added includes

Base functionality
------------------
* Dispersion + testing
    * At extraction
    * At multipoles
    * At custom elements (massless septa?)
* Testing momentum shifts (off resonance extraction)
* Testing of extraction bump?
* Testing configurations of multipoles and higher order multipoles

Inner workings of the code
--------------------------
* Transition to pandas for tracks? (Performance?)
* Change output format for tracking?


Other features
--------------
* Proper data processing tools
* Extraction septum with length for losses (separate losses in output?)
